			<h2>Hi, I'm Ayush!</h2>
			<p>One of the nicest and most fulfilling events of my life so far was my vacation to the Ocean City. There were new sights and adventures every day of the voyage, as is to be anticipated from such a wide territory and dangerous mode of transportation. I discovered what the majority of other travel writers have probably also discovered in my attempt to verbalize this adventure. zx</p>
