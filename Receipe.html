		<p>A well-known street cuisine from Nepal is Nepalese Chicken Sekuwa Recipe. In addition to using an oven here to make it much more practical for home cooking, it is typically cooked on an open charcoal grill. This recipe is very tasty because of the overnight marinating and the use of Timur (Himalayan Spice). a really straightforward recipe that calls for marinating and grilling.
		The secret is to marinate the chicken for at least eight hours to let the flavors to penetrate the moist meat. This is why I adore Sekuwa so much.</p>
